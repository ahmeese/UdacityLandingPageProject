## UsedTools
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

We used the [IntersectorObserverApi](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) to check if the section is in the viewport or not and to make sure that the section is totally in the viewport by 
assiging threshold property to 1.

Using Intersector  give more performance to the pageinstead of adding event listener to it.
